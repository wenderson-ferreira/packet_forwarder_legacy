# Packet Forwarder

**⚠️ The development of this packet forwarder has been put on hold. We're currently working on new tools to make gateways easier to manage, that we will make public when ready. In the meanwhile, we recommend to use other packet forwarders ([Semtech packet forwarder](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder), [MP packet forwarder](https://github.com/kersing/packet_forwarder)). To learn more, join the discussion on [the forum](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/new-ttn-packet-forwarder-available/7644/46).**

Packet forwarder to make the link between a LoRa concentrator and [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org)'s backend.

This packet forwarder **isn't destined** to [The Things Gateway](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/gateway/)'s users, but for users who **already have a gateway** from another vendor, and that want to connect it to The Things Network.

Installation manuals are available for main available gateways:

+ [Kerlink IoT Station installation manual](docs/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/KERLINK.md)
+ [Multitech Conduit installation manual](docs/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/MULTITECH.md)
+ [Raspberry Pi + IMST ic880a installation manual](docs/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/IMST_RPI.md)

## <a name="build"></a>Build

If you have a custom-made gateway, or if you want to contribute to the development of the packet forwarder, you will have to build the binary yourself.

### <a name="run"></a>Run

```bash
$ packet-forwarder configure
$ packet-forwarder start
```

#### Configuration format and flags

The configuration file generated by `packet-forwarder configure` is stored at `$HOME/.pktfwd.yml`. You can specify a different config file with the `--config` flag, or specify runtime parameters with the different flags:

* `--id`: Gateway ID of the present gateway.
* `--key`: Gateway key of the present gateway.
* `--router`: ID of the router with which communicate (optional ; default: account server-stored router)
* `--auth-server`: URI of the account server (optional ; default: `https://account.thethingsnetwork.org`)
* `--discovery-server`: Address and port of the discovery server (optional ; default: `discover.thethingsnetwork.org:1900`)
* `--verbose` or `-v`: Show debugging information (optional)
* `--downlink-send-margin`: Change downlink send margin, in milliseconds (optional ; [see documentation](docs/IMPLEMENTATION/DOWNLINKS.md))
* `--gps-path`: Set GPS path to enable GPS support (optional ; default: empty)
* `--ignore-crc`: Ignore CRC check, and send uplink packets upstream even if they are CRC-invalid.
